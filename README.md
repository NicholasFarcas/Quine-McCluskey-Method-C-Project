# Quine-McCluskey-Method-C-Project
Project that is in progress that will accept minterms and simplify them via the Quine McCluskey method and output the implicant formula. Currently working on a function to 
convert the minterms from base ten to boolean/base two that will return an array. From there will create a function simplifying the provided minterms in order to be left with
only the mandatory prime implicants, will need to later create a function simplifying the prime implicants into a formula, and a final function to output the simplified
minterm formula in text (eg. f(m0, m1, m2, . . . ) = A'B + BC + . . . )
